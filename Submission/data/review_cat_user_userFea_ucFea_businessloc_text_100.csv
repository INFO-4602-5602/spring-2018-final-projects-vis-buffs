If you reserve on open table I think there is only one table they seat you at and it is next to the server stand.  You might want to call if this annoys you. It does put you in Josh's section so that's the plus side.  

They also make tasty drinks and stock Laphroaig.  The last waiter (not Josh) put ice in my scotch, since I did not ask for it on the rocks it was annoying.  However it is a cardinal sin to waste scotch.  

I love that it is not in a casino and that it is quite low key.

They are not your grandmothers Mexican food, so if you go in expecting some high end del taco you will be disappointed. If you are that kind foodie you are not likely to be on yelp.

In fact they have competing museums of awesome child centric wonder.  Of course they are also places you want to raise children, face it Vegas is not. 

The one issue I have about children's museums is parents who go.  They allow their children to act like brainless monkeys who are merely pushing every button they can without regard to what is actually happening.  Sorry morons but you dont get Hamlet by chaining your monkeys to a typewriter. 

This annoys me vastly because often the girls are pushed aside while they are attempting the scientific function of a display by some subnormal child who is looking to just spin the wheel.   If your child is going to act like an animal do us all a favor and leash them and bring them to the park. The rest of us would like to learn about the physics involved. 

The Lied displays are also inaccurate esp the food pyramid one. I am sorry but who says you can intake as many FRIED eggs and glasses of Chocolate Milk as you want. While also claiming that trail mix is bad for you.  Was this exhibit paid for by the Dairy Board?

Short story: 
I booked a night at the Quad. Possible bed bugs. Dusty, dirty room after room change. Horrendous service. We spent from 6 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. trying to sort out the situation. I wish I had not gone to Las Vegas.

Long story: 
Early January, I booked a classic room for the Quad for Friday, 3/22/13. My fianc and I flew in to Las Vegas, Nevada and arrived at the Quad around 3 p.m. At the check-in counter in the Quad, the lady behind the check-in counter said the classic room is a far walk, and I would have to take two elevators to reach there. She asked if I wanted to upgrade to one of the main towers, a deluxe room, for $11.20. I agree, and was charged $132.15 + $11.20 for one night. My fianc and I went up to the room, and it looked like a normal hotel room with one king sized bed. She decided to nap, and I went to Venetian to play games. 

When she woke up from her nap around 6 p.m., she found that her leg was itchy and had some red dots on it probably from bed bugs. (I have pictures, but they did not come out clear. I am not a very good photographer.) She came over to Venetian and showed me. We went back to the Quad and asked the front desk for a room change. The lady (a different one than before) gave us a room in the classic tower, one of the rooms with the far walk, and instructed us to file a report. A kind and patient officer met us at our room to file a report. Afterwards, he said to call a number for the next steps of the report. My fianc called the number, CCMSI (Cannon Cochran Management Services, Inc.), a third party that deals with complaint reports, but they said that no one was in the office until Monday. The operator said they would put the manager, Angela Cefao(sp?) on the phone, but she was busy on the time. They instructed her to call back.

We were cold and turned on the heater. Next, we noticed a dust cloud in the room and concluded the heater was covered in dust. Furthermore, I noticed some green, extravagant mold or corrosion of some sort on the panel underneath the heater. We turned off the heater, but my fianc was cold. In addition, we noticed a funny blanket in the room. The blanket was about the size for a twin sized bed. There were what looked to be small, curly, pubic hairs on the blanket. She was also suffering from allergies at this point, and she had to stick her head out the window for the allergies to clear. At that point, I wanted to switch to another room that was not covered in dust, and I realized that the check-in counter lady gave us a classic room and did not refund my $11.20 back for the deluxe room. I went to the front desk, about 10 minutes away with two elevator rides and a walk now. I went to ask for the $11.20 refund, explain about my situation, ask for a room change, and ask for an extra blanket. The lady behind the check-in counter said all the rooms are full, and they cannot reimburse us for anything because they do not have the power to do so. I was exhausted.

I went back upstairs. I forgot about the blankets. I went back to the room to find my fianc bundled up in the blankets WITH the funny blanket on her. I told her to not to use the blanket, but she was cold. She was miserable. She could not breathe because of the dust. Her legs were itchy. We were miserable. It was almost 3 (three) a.m now, and the manager still did not call back. We were limited on options. We had nowhere to go. I did not want to travel 10 (ten) minutes to the front desk to ask for blankets because I did not want to leave her side. I tried calling front desk using the land line phone in the room. I was on hold for a total of 35 (thirty-five) minutes, and no human answered the phone. I was agitated. Reluctantly, I went down to the front desk. I saw the manager behind a booth in a suit and a lady behind the check-in counter both available. Both of them were not helping customers nor on the phone. Why couldn't they pick up the phone? I just wanted a blanket and make the living conditions a little bearable. I talked to the manager. She sharply refused me about any actions. She said she could not do anything about the condition of the rooms nor switch us to another room because all the rooms were booked. They were also out of blankets. I went back upstairs and covered my fianc in jackets and held her close to keep her warm.

On Monday, my fianc called the third party to complete the report. They said they will look into it. On April 18, 2013, I received a letter from the third party. They said they cannot conclude anything from the report and cannot help us out with anything. What a waste of a night. What a waste of time, money, and energy. In the end, we had to suffer through a night with nowhere to go. I had an abysmal experience with no one helping us out.

My fianc and I flew in to Las Vegas, Nevada and arrived at the Quad around 3 p.m. At the check-in counter in the Quad, the lady behind the check-in counter said the classic room is a far walk, and I would have to take two elevators to reach there. She asked if I wanted to upgrade to one of the main towers, a deluxe room, for $11.20. I agree, and was charged $132.15 + $11.20 for one night. My fianc and I went up to the room, and it looked like a normal hotel room with one king sized bed. She decided to nap, and I went to Venetian to play games. 

When she woke up from her nap around 6 p.m., she found that her leg was itchy and had some red dots on it probably from bed bugs. (I have pictures, but they did not come out clear. I am not a very good photographer.) She came over to Venetian and showed me. We went back to the Quad and asked the front desk for a room change. The lady (a different one than before) gave us a room in the classic tower, one of the rooms with the far walk, and instructed us to file a report. A kind and patient officer met us at our room to file a report. Afterwards, he said to call a number for the next steps of the report. My fianc called the number, CCMSI (Cannon Cochran Management Services, Inc.), a third party that deals with complaint reports, but they said that no one was in the office until Monday. The operator said they would put the manager, Angela Cefao(sp?) on the phone, but she was busy on the time. They instructed her to call back.

We were cold and turned on the heater. Next, we noticed a dust cloud in the room and concluded the heater was covered in dust. Furthermore, I noticed some green, extravagant mold or corrosion of some sort on the panel underneath the heater. We turned off the heater, but my fianc was cold. In addition, we noticed a funny blanket in the room. The blanket was about the size for a twin sized bed. There were what looked to be small, curly, pubic hairs on the blanket. She was also suffering from allergies at this point, and she had to stick her head out the window for the allergies to clear. At that point, I wanted to switch to another room that was not covered in dust, and I realized that the check-in counter lady gave us a classic room and did not refund my $11.20 back for the deluxe room. I went to the front desk, about 10 minutes away with two elevator rides and a walk now. I went to ask for the $11.20 refund, explain about my situation, ask for a room change, and ask for an extra blanket. The lady behind the check-in counter said all the rooms are full, and they cannot reimburse us for anything because they do not have the power to do so. I was exhausted.

I went back upstairs. I forgot about the blankets. I went back to the room to find my fianc bundled up in the blankets WITH the funny blanket on her. I told her to not to use the blanket, but she was cold. She was miserable. She could not breathe because of the dust. Her legs were itchy. We were miserable. It was almost 3 (three) a.m now, and the manager still did not call back. We were limited on options. We had nowhere to go. I did not want to travel 10 (ten) minutes to the front desk to ask for blankets because I did not want to leave her side. I tried calling front desk using the land line phone in the room. I was on hold for a total of 35 (thirty-five) minutes, and no human answered the phone. I was agitated. Reluctantly, I went down to the front desk. I saw the manager behind a booth in a suit and a lady behind the check-in counter both available. Both of them were not helping customers nor on the phone. Why couldn't they pick up the phone? I just wanted a blanket and make the living conditions a little bearable. I talked to the manager. She sharply refused me about any actions. She said she could not do anything about the condition of the rooms nor switch us to another room because all the rooms were booked. They were also out of blankets. I went back upstairs and covered my fianc in jackets and held her close to keep her warm.

On Monday, my fianc called the third party to complete the report. They said they will look into it. On April 18, 2013, I received a letter from the third party. They said they cannot conclude anything from the report and cannot help us out with anything. What a waste of a night. What a waste of time, money, and energy. In the end, we had to suffer through a night with nowhere to go. I had an abysmal experience with no one helping us out.

Oben angekommen hat man einen fantastischen Blick auf Las Vegas und die angrenzenden Berge. Wem das zu wenig ist kann sich hier beim ""Skyjump"" 260 Meter in die Tiefe strzen. Sehr interessant den Adrenalinjunkies kurz vor dem Sprung zuzusehen. Kurz vor dem Ende wird der Sturz von einer Seilwinde abgebremst. Wer schon Bungee Jumping gemacht hat, k?nnte vielleicht entt?uscht sein. Der Spa? kostet derzeit 119,99 $.

Wer noch mehr Adrenalinschub braucht, kann auf der darber liegenden Plattform, wo sich frher eine kleine Achterbahn befand, den ""Big Shot"" ausprobieren. Hierbei k?nnen bis zu 16 Fahrg?ste mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 72 km/h in die H?he katapultiert werden. Von oben geht es dann wieder nach anf?nglicher Schwerelosigkeit im freien Fall nach unten.

Sehr spannend sah das zweite Fahrgesch?ft ""X-Scream"" aus. Hier k?nnen bis zu acht Fahrg?ste in einem Achterbahnwagen ber den Rand das Stratosphere Towers sich ins Nichts bef?rdern lassen bevor das Fahrzeug abbremst. Mir wurde schon beim Zuschauen fast schlecht, wenn die Besucher von der Rampe in ihrem Fahrzeug hin und her geschleudert wurden.

Am gruseligsten fand ich das Karussell ""Insanity"", das wirklich nur was fr wahnsinnige ist. Der Metallarm des Fahrgesch?ftes, an dem die Sitze befestigt sind, dreht sich irgendwann Richtung Las Vegas Strip au?erhalb des Towers und die Fahrg?ste schweben im Kreis mit Blickrichtung Abgrund.

Sehr interessant den Adrenalinjunkies kurz vor dem Sprung zuzusehen. Kurz vor dem Ende wird der Sturz von einer Seilwinde abgebremst. Wer schon Bungee Jumping gemacht hat, k?nnte vielleicht entt?uscht sein. Der Spa? kostet derzeit 119,99 $.

Wer noch mehr Adrenalinschub braucht, kann auf der darber liegenden Plattform, wo sich frher eine kleine Achterbahn befand, den ""Big Shot"" ausprobieren. Hierbei k?nnen bis zu 16 Fahrg?ste mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 72 km/h in die H?he katapultiert werden. Von oben geht es dann wieder nach anf?nglicher Schwerelosigkeit im freien Fall nach unten.

Sehr spannend sah das zweite Fahrgesch?ft ""X-Scream"" aus. Hier k?nnen bis zu acht Fahrg?ste in einem Achterbahnwagen ber den Rand das Stratosphere Towers sich ins Nichts bef?rdern lassen bevor das Fahrzeug abbremst. Mir wurde schon beim Zuschauen fast schlecht, wenn die Besucher von der Rampe in ihrem Fahrzeug hin und her geschleudert wurden.

Am gruseligsten fand ich das Karussell ""Insanity"", das wirklich nur was fr wahnsinnige ist. Der Metallarm des Fahrgesch?ftes, an dem die Sitze befestigt sind, dreht sich irgendwann Richtung Las Vegas Strip au?erhalb des Towers und die Fahrg?ste schweben im Kreis mit Blickrichtung Abgrund.

Die 3 Fahrgesch?fte k?nnen im Package fr 36 $ gebucht werden. Fr mich, der an H?henangst leidet, war das Zuschauen schon eine Zumutung.

?berzeugt hatte uns, der gnstige Preis mit 250,- $ fr vier N?chte, die gro?en Suites mit Kche und extra Wohnzimmer, kostenlose Parkpl?tze, kostenfreies WLAN, 2 Flatscreens, die nahegelegene Monorailstation und das fr gut befundene Frhstck. Dieses Hotel ist eines der wenigen in Las Vegas, das ein inkludiertes Frhstck anbietet.

Zwischendurch kamen mir aber Zweifel, denn auf Yelp waren die Bewertungen fast ausschlie?lich schlecht, aber auf anderen Bewertungsportalen waren aber auch positive Bewertungen zu lesen. Ich hatte dann auf ein besseres und kurzfristiges gnstigeres Angebot gewartet und habe leider die Stornierungsfrist von 4 Tagen bersehen. Sehr ungew?hnlich.

-----------
My recent stay at the Wynn left me incredibly underwhelmed. There were several problems during our stay.

1. Although check in was at 3pm.  Our rooms were not available until after 5pm.

2. I asked for tape upon check in. I called at least 3 times from check in until the following morning before tape was brought to my room. I would have appreciated follow up from the hotel.

3. In the morning of 6/2 the tv in 5846 did not work. I called for service and a new remote was brought to our room. It did not work. I called and asked that the tv should be serviced during the day. When I returned to the room after 6pm, the tv still did not work. Someone came to fix the tv after 6 pm but it took an entire day to service something so simple.

4. Housekeeping closed the doors connecting our 2  rooms on 6/2 so my friend could not retrieve her items from the adjoining room. It took an hour before someone came to fix the problem.

5. I left my sweater in 5848. I find your $15 admin fee  for returned items to be outrageous.

6. Coffee makers are not in the rooms. That should be standard.

7. The refrigerators are stocked full of your merchandise. A $25 rental fee for a refrigerator is ridiculous. 

8. There were several times that no one answered the front desk phone, housekeeping phone or concierge phone.

Most of these items were minor inconveniences that luckily did not dampen our Las Vegas experience however I am confident that other hotels can do better.

I hope that you make some significant improvements to enhance your guests' experiences.

-----------
My recent stay at the Wynn left me incredibly underwhelmed. There were several problems during our stay.

1. Although check in was at 3pm.  Our rooms were not available until after 5pm.

2. I asked for tape upon check in. I called at least 3 times from check in until the following morning before tape was brought to my room. I would have appreciated follow up from the hotel.

3. In the morning of 6/2 the tv in 5846 did not work. I called for service and a new remote was brought to our room. It did not work. I called and asked that the tv should be serviced during the day. When I returned to the room after 6pm, the tv still did not work. Someone came to fix the tv after 6 pm but it took an entire day to service something so simple.

4. Housekeeping closed the doors connecting our 2  rooms on 6/2 so my friend could not retrieve her items from the adjoining room. It took an hour before someone came to fix the problem.

5. I left my sweater in 5848. I find your $15 admin fee  for returned items to be outrageous.

6. Coffee makers are not in the rooms. That should be standard.

7. The refrigerators are stocked full of your merchandise. A $25 rental fee for a refrigerator is ridiculous. 

8. There were several times that no one answered the front desk phone, housekeeping phone or concierge phone.

Most of these items were minor inconveniences that luckily did not dampen our Las Vegas experience however I am confident that other hotels can do better.

I hope that you make some significant improvements to enhance your guests' experiences.

I gobbled up my Shack burger quickly, it was so good. I liked the soft hamburger bun and juicy cheesy patty. I'm not a fan of mushrooms, but I did have a bite of the Shack Stack and liked it! I especially loved the tasty muenster cheese, I started dipping my fries in it when I got the chance ;] The crinkle cut fries were crispy and delicious. I will for sure try the cheese fries next time.

The woman who took our order was really friendly. She noticed my boyfriend's taiko jacket and started small talk about taiko :) Also, somebody came around to ask customers if they needed anything.

And maybe it could be just from the excitement of finally getting to try this place, but there it is. I've only had this place once and I'll have to wait until the one in LA opens to try it again, but my first experience at this location was so good. Had to stop by when we were in Vegas. I've heard so much about this place and just had to judge for myself.

Lots of Clevelanders are giving this a 5 star rating, and I am sure they've got some great memories, but this isn't a 5 star ballpark. It's very attractive from the inside, and has quite a bit going for it, but it also has some major flaws.

So let's start with the good: it's situated right in the heart of Cleveland, and you can literally walk to adjacent bars in less than a minute. It's great for ""hanging out"" before and after the game. It also has a very nice design to the field, and everything feels very modern on the inside. There are decent food choices, somewhat reasonably priced, by all seating sections- including the nose bleeds. I also saw one heck of a memorable game here, including Jim Thome's 602nd career home run. That's always a nice bonus. Speaking of that, the atmosphere was one of the better one's I've experienced. When Thome hit that home run it was as loud as almost any stadium I've been to. 

Now the bad: It's ugly from the outside. Especially from what you see on the interstate. I suppose it is almost 20 years old now, but it looks nice on the inside, why should it look that way on the outside. The food wasn't very good. Since I try to see every stadium and compare them, I try to get the same thing at every ballpark- I get a hotdog and fries and my wife gets pizza. The hotdog was gross. It was among the worst hot dogs I've had at ballparks. It almost tasted old. The pizza was pretty good, and very very cheesy... but Hot Dogs are where it's at for a game, and it just wasn't very good. It took a long, long time to get to our seats, but that may have been our own fault for what gate we entered. We went in what appeared to be the main entrance, and it took us nearly 10 minutes to walk to our seat. The other bad things is this is a stadium that still lives in the dark ages of not letting you bring in your own outside food and beverage. Not even water bottles. Get with the times. Also, when you order their drinks they don't give you a lid or a straw. I asked the guy at the station why not and he had no idea what the reason was, and he didn't understand it... he was just told it was a ""Safety"" thing. The locals I went to the game with said it's because sometimes the fans get unruly and throw stuff like that onto the field. That's great, but the stadium giveaway was a ceramic mug.

Finally, the worst of all: The traffic situation. We parked right next to the stadium in one of the overpriced lots to be as close as possible and have the best access. It took us an HOUR to get out of the city. Apparently they are filming a movie there (The Avengers?) so that exacerbated the problem, but it was easily the longest I've ever had to wait to get out of a stadium.
