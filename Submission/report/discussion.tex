In the project, we conducted a visualization of Yelp rating prediction. This visualization not only visualize the data but also visualize the machine learning process, as to reveal information in the "black box". With four parts of visualization, 1) features, 2) best split, 3) feature ranking, 4) tree model, we can understand the Decision Tree model better and gain insights of each part through visualizations.
