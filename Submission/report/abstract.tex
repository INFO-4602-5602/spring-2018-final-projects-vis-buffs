%\textcolor{red}{Your motivating problem, what you did, and what you found}

Yelp is a crowd-sourced local business review and social networking community, which has hundreds of thousands of users contribute their data every day. Based on users' reviews and ratings, good local businesses stand out among their categories on top of the list, acting as a word-of-mouth reference. However, tons of user data doesn't make any sense unless we make good use of it. In this case, we decided to look into the problem that how we might get as much as useful information from our data with a particular interest in how the users' rating behavior are influenced by different factors, and what kind of prediction we can make out of the rating pattern we found. With various features extracted from Yelp data, we conducted feature selection, best split and finally built a Decision Tree model which predicts users' rating based on those features. Our visualization includes the complete process of this typical machine learning method, which provides insights about the inner mechanism of how the rating prediction is conducted.
