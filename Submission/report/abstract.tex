\textcolor{red}{Your motivating problem, what you did, and what you found}

Yelp is a crowd-sourced local business review and social networking community, which has hundreds of thousands of users contribute their data every day. Based on users' reviews and ratings, good local businesses stand out among their categories on top of the list, acting as a word-of-mouth reference. However, tons of user data doesn't make any sense unless we make good use of it. In this case, we decided to look into the problem that how we might get as much as useful information from our data with a particular interest in how the users' rating behavior are influenced by different data attributes, and what kind of prediction we can make out of the rating pattern we found.
